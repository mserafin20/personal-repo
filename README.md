## For Practice and to test functionality 

The motivation behind this project was to refactor the HTML elements and adjust their corresponding CSS selectors so that the finished product matched the mock up with semantic HTML. 

The first step I took when examining this project was to look at the index.html file and convert all <div> elements to semantic HTML. I then switched over to the style.css file and adjusted the appropriate elements there. The main changes I made to the CSS file were removing class selectors from the box descriptions which allowed the website to function normally. 

The main thing I've learned from this is that semantic HTML looks much cleaner than using a whole bunch of <div> and in order to become more functional in CSS, a lot of practice is required.
